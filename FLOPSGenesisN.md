**FLOPSGenesisNode refers to a decentralized AI compute initiative under the FLOPS Protocol, designed to reward contributors for their compute power and enable governance over AI infrastructure.**

Here's a breakdown of what FLOPSGenesisNode is and how it fits into the broader FLOPS ecosystem:

### 🧠 What Is FLOPSGenesisNode?

FLOPSGenesisNode is part of the **FLOPS Protocol**, a decentralized AI infrastructure project that aims to democratize access to AI model training and governance. It operates within a **dual-track system**:

- **FLOPS Credits Track**: Contributors earn credits by providing compute power to train AI models. These credits offer exposure to mining rewards, token unlocks, and airdrops.
- **FLOPS Token Governance Track**: Token holders participate in treasury governance, strategic decisions, and protocol evolution through community voting.

The GenesisNode likely refers to **early participants or nodes** in this decentralized network who contribute compute resources and help bootstrap the protocol’s AI training capabilities.

### 🔧 Key Features of FLOPS Protocol

- **Decentralized AI Mining**: Aggregates demand across multiple AI protocols, similar to early Bitcoin mining strategies.
- **Transparent Governance**: Community-driven decisions on treasury allocation and protocol strategies.
- **Separation of Utility and Governance**: Mining rewards are distributed via credits, while governance is handled through tokens.
- **Protocol Milestones**:
  - *Q2 2025*: Token auction completed ($171M FDV).
  - *Q3 2025*: Governance framework activated.
  - *Q4 2025*: Mining strategies implemented.
  - *Q1 2026*: Value-accrual mechanisms deployed.
